# Getting Started with `pest`

In this chapter, we'll guide you through the process of setting up a new project and creating a 
basic API using `pest`.

## Installing the CLI

The first step is to install the `pest` CLI. Open your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
pip install pest-cli
```

> While using the CLI is not mandatory, it simplifies the process of creating new projects.
> It doesn't need to be a dependency of your project; you can install it globally.

## Creating a new project

Now that `pest-cli` is installed, let's kickstart our haunted-houses project:

```bash
pest generate application haunted-houses --dm poetry
```

This command creates a new pest project using poetry as the dependency manager. Ensure poetry is
installed on your machine for this to work. If you don't have poetry installed or don't want to
install it, you can omit the `--dm poetry` flag, and `pest-cli` will prompt you to choose a
dependency manager. As of the time of writing this tutorial, `pest-cli` supports poetry and
`requirements.txt`. If you prefer using a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the
dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and you're good to go.

### Running the project

Now that the project is created, let's install the dependencies:

```bash
cd haunted-houses
poetry install
```

Next, run the project:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['D:\\users\\lucas\\Desktop\\appp\\poetry']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000; you should see a JSON response similar to
this:

```json
{
    "hello": "pest!"
}
```

## Project structure

Let's take a look at the project structure generated by pest-cli:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="hello" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="greeter_service.py" />
            <FileTree.File name="hello_controller.py" />
            <FileTree.File name="module.py" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="app_module.py" />
    <FileTree.File name="main.py" />
</FileTree>


### app_module.py

This file contains the main/root [module](../overview/modules.mdx) of the application.

It instructs `pest` on how to locate the controllers and services within the application.

The main module can directly import other controllers or services, or it can import other modules
that define their own controllers and services. In this instance, the `AppModule` imports the
`HelloModule`, a feature module that encapsulates the "greeting" feature of the application.

<InfoBox title="ðŸ“„ app_module.py">
    Here's how the `app_module.py` file looks:

    ```python
    from pest.decorators.module import module
    from .hello.module import HelloModule

    @module(
        imports=[HelloModule],
    )
    class AppModule:
        pass
    ```

    The `@module` decorator defines a module, and the `imports` argument is used to import
    other modules into the current module. In this case, we're importing the `HelloModule` into the
    `AppModule`.
</InfoBox>

### hello/module.py

This is a [feature module](../overview/modules.mdx#feature-modules), encapsulating a specific
feature of the application.

In the case of `HelloModule`, it encapsulates the greeting feature, composed of a controller
(`HelloController`) and a service (`GreeterService`).

<InfoBox title="ðŸ“„ hello/module.py">
    Here's how the `hello/module.py` file looks:

    ```python
    from pest import module
    from .greeter_service import GreeterService
    from .hello_controller import HelloController

    @module(
        controllers=[HelloController],
        providers=[GreeterService],
    )
    class HelloModule:
        pass
    ```

    The controller defines the routes of the application, and the service contains the
    business logic. `pest` injects the service, making it available for injection across all
    controllers and providers of the module. In this example, we have one controller and one 
    service, but you can have as many as needed.
</InfoBox>

### hello/greeter_service.py

This file represents a [provider](../overview/modules.mdx#providers). Typically, a provider or
service contains the business logic of the application. 

While a controller handles requests and returns responses on specific routes, a service manages
the business logic.


In the usual workflow, a controller calls a service to handle the business logic and return a 
response to the client.

<InfoBox title="ðŸ“„ hello/greeter_service.py">
    Here's how the `hello/greeter_service.py` file looks:

    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    class Greet(BaseModel):
        """A greeting"""
        hello: str
        '''The greeting'''

    class GreeterService:
        """The haunted house service"""
        def say_hello(self) -> Greet:
            """Say hello"""
            return Greet(hello="pest!")
    ```

    This is a simple service that returns a greeting.
</InfoBox>  

### hello/hello_controller.py

This file serves as a [controller](../overview/modules.mdx#controllers), responsible for
handling requests and returning responses on specific routes.

`pest` automatically invokes the appropriate route handler (a method of the controller) based on the
HTTP method and path of the request.

Typically, a controller delegates business logic handling to a service and returns a response
to the client.

<InfoBox title="ðŸ“„ hello/hello_controller.py">
    Here's how the `hello/hello_controller.py` file looks:

    ```python
    from pest import controller, get
    from .greeter_service import Greet, GreeterService

    @controller("/")
    class HelloController:
        """say hello routes"""
        service: GreeterService  # ðŸ’‰ injected

        @get("/")
        def say_hello(self) -> Greet:
            """Say hello"""
            return self.service.say_hello()
    ```

    This defines a controller with a single route handler. The handler is triggered when a GET
    request is made to the root path of the application. It calls the `say_hello` method of the
    `GreeterService` and returns its response.
</InfoBox> 

### main.py

This is the entrypoint of the application. It contains the `main` function that starts the
application. Remember when we ran `poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`? The `app.main:app`
part tells uvicorn to look for the `app` module and the `app` variable inside the `main.py` file
and mount it as the root application.

## OpenAPI

Thanks to [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), pest automatically generates an OpenAPI
specification for your application and mounts a Swagger UI at `/docs` and a ReDoc UI at `/redoc`.

* [`/docs` - Swagger UI](http://localhost:8000/docs)
* [`/redoc` - ReDoc UI](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to create a new project using `pest-cli`, and we've delved into
each file generated by it, learning how they collaborate to create a simple API.

In the following chapters, we will modify this project to add more features and learn more about 
`pest`.
