# Haunted Houses Repository

In this section, we'll delve into the implementation details of the `HauntedHousesRepository`. 

This repository acts as a mock storage system for haunted houses, providing basic methods for
retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting haunted houses.

This is not exactly `pest`-specific, but we will use it in this getting-started guide to simulate a
database or any other storage system.

We will use an in-memory list to simulate a database and to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
Delete) operations for haunted house entities.

## The model

Let's start by defining the model for our haunted houses. We'll use a python model for this:


```python filename="app/haunted_houses/repository.py" 
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HauntedHouse(BaseModel):
    """Model for a spooky house"""
    id: int
    name: str
    ghost_count: int
```

## The repository

Now, let's move on to creating the repository. Our approach is simple: we'll use a basic list to
store information about our haunted houses.

```python filename="app/haunted_houses/repository.py" {9-16}
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HauntedHouse(BaseModel):
    """A spooky house"""
    id: int
    name: str
    ghost_count: int

class HauntedHousesRepository:
    """Mock repository for haunted houses"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.houses: list[HauntedHouse] = [
            HauntedHouse(id=1, name="Spooky Manor", ghost_count=5),
            HauntedHouse(id=2, name="Eerie Estate", ghost_count=3),
        ]
```

The `__init__` method initializes the repository with a predefined list of haunted houses, where
each haunted house is represented by an instance of the `HauntedHouse` class.

## CRUD operations

With our haunted houses repository in place, it's time to implement the standard CRUD (Create, Read,
Update, Delete) operations. Let's dive into the code and bring our repository to life.

from pydantic import BaseModel

class HauntedHouse(BaseModel):
    """A spooky house"""
    id: int

    ghost_count: int

class HauntedHousesRepository:
    """Mock repository for haunted houses"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.houses: list[HauntedHouse] = [
            HauntedHouse(id=1, name="Spooky Manor", ghost_count=5),
            HauntedHouse(id=2, name="Eerie Estate", ghost_count=3),
        ]

    def get_all_houses(self) -> list[HauntedHouse]:
        return self.houses

    def get_house_by_id(self, house_id: int) -> HauntedHouse | None:
        return next((house for house in self.houses if house.id == house_id), None)

    def create_house(self, house: HauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse:
        new_id = max(house.id for house in self.houses) + 1
        new_house = HauntedHouse(id=new_id, name=house.name, ghost_count=house.ghost_count)
        self.houses.append(new_house)
        return new_house

    def update_house(self, house_id: int, updated_house: HauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse | None:
        house_index = next(
            (index for index, house in enumerate(self.houses) if house.id == house_id),
            None
        )
        if house_index is not None:
            self.houses[house_index] = updated_house
            return updated_house

    def delete_house(self, house_id: int) -> None:
        self.houses = [house for house in self.houses if house.id != house_id]

```

- `get_all_houses`: Returns a list containing all the haunted houses currently stored in the 
  repository.

- `get_house_by_id`: Retrieves a specific haunted house from the repository based on its unique
  identifier.

- `create_house`: Adds a new haunted house to the repository.

- `update_house`: Modifies the details of an existing haunted house in the repository.

- `delete_house`: Removes a haunted house from the repository.
