# The Controller layer

In this section, we will delve into the creation of the HauntedHousesController class. The
controller is a crucial component in any web API, responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests
and returning appropriate responses. The controller will define the routes and actions for managing
haunted houses.

## HauntedHousesController class

[When we first introduced the Hounted House API](../haunted-house-api), we mentioned that our API
would respond to HTTP requests for managing haunted houses CRUD operations (create, read, update,
delete). 

The place where we define these routes and actions is in the HauntedHousesController class.

A Controller is a class decorated with the `@controller` decorator.

The decorator takes, at least, one argument: the route prefix. This is the prefix that will be
prepended to all the routes defined in the controller.

Each route (also known as request handler) is defined by a method decorated with one of the HTTP
method decorators: `@get`, `@post`, `@put`, `@delete` provided by <PestTag/>.

Let's create the `HauntedHousesController` class in the `haunted_houses_controller.py` file and 
implement our first request handler: a `get_houses` method that will receive and handle 
`GET /haunted-houses` requests.

```python filename="app/haunted_houses/haunted_houses_controller.py"
from pest import controller, get, post, put, delete
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .haunted_houses_repository import HauntedHouse

@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
    """Haunted-houses routes"""

    service: HauntedHousesService  # 游눌 injected
    
    @get("/")
    def get_houses(self) -> list[HauntedHouse]:
        """Get all haunted houses"""
        return self.service.get_houses()
```

A lot is going on in this small code snippet, so let's break it down.

```python filename="app/haunted_houses/haunted_houses_controller.py"
@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
```

By decorating the `HauntedHousesController` class with the `@controller` decorator, we are telling
<PestTag/> that this class is, in fact, a controller and that all the routes defined in it will have
the prefix `/haunted-houses`.

```python filename="app/haunted_houses/haunted_houses_controller.py"
    service: HauntedHousesService  # 游눌 injected
```

The `HauntedHousesController` class has a `service` attribute that is of type 
`HauntedHousesService`. Notice that we are not instantiating the service class, but rather declaring
it as a class attribute. When <PestTag/> instantiates the controller, it will also instantiate the
service as a required dependency and inject it into the controller.

```python filename="app/haunted_houses/haunted_houses_controller.py"
    @get("/")
    def get_houses(self) -> list[HauntedHouse]:
        """Get all haunted houses"""
        return self.service.get_houses()
```

- The `get_houses` method is decorated with the `@get("/")` decorator, which tells <PestTag/> that
this method will handle `GET` requests to root `/haunted-houses` route.

- The docstring of the method will be used as the description of the route in the OpenAPI schema.

- The method returns a list of `HauntedHouse` objects; but since `HauntedHouse` is a pydantic model,
  and <PestTag/> is built on top of <FastapiTag/>, the response will be automatically serialized to 
  JSON.

- We don't usually do much inside the controller methods. Instead, we delegate the business logic to
  a service class. In this case, we are calling the `get_houses` method of the 
  `HauntedHousesService` class and returning the result. This is not mandatory, but it is a good
  practice to keep the controller methods as simple as possible. 

  Ideally, A controller should have transport-layer related logic only, like parsing the request,
  validating the request, data transformation, etc. The business logic should be delegated to a 
  service class. <PestTag/> and <FastapiTag/> automatically take care of a lot of theses things for
  us before even reaching our handler, and after the handler returns.

### Let's test it!

Before implementing the rest of the controller, let's test what we have so far.

In order to do so, we need to go back to the `HauntedHousesModule` class again and add the
controller class to the `controllers` list in order to register it inside the module so that
<PestTag/> can find it.

```python filename="app/haunted_houses/haunted_houses_module.py" {2,7}
from pest import module
from .haunted_houses_controller import HauntedHousesController
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .haunted_houses_repository import HauntedHousesRepository

@module(
    controllers=[HauntedHousesController],
    providers=[HauntedHousesService, HauntedHousesRepository],
)
class HauntedHousesModule:
    pass
```

We are ready to try our route. Let's start the server and make a request to the `/haunted-houses`
route.

```bash
$ uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

You should see a JSON list of haunted houses. Nice!


## Define rest of the request handlers (or routes)

Now that we know how to define a route, let's define the rest of the routes for managing all the
CRUD operations for haunted houses.

### Get a haunted house by id

```python filename="app/haunted_houses/haunted_houses_controller.py" {13-16}
from pest import controller, get, post, put, delete
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .haunted_houses_repository import HauntedHouse

@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
    """Haunted-houses routes"""

    service: HauntedHousesService  # 游눌 injected
    
    ...

    @get("/{house_id}")
    def get_house_by_id(self, house_id: int) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Get a haunted house by ID"""
        return self.service.get_house_by_id(house_id)
```

Nothing too different from the previous route. Except that this time, we are defining a route with
a path parameter: `/{house_id}`. The path parameter will be passed as an argument to the method.

This means that the `get_house_by_id` method will receive a `house_id` argument of type `int` and 
value 1 when the route `/haunted-houses/1` is requested.

By using our service instance, we can get the haunted house by id and return it.

### Create a haunted house

When we want to create stuff, we usually use the `POST` HTTP method. Let's create a route for
creating haunted houses.

```python filename="app/haunted_houses/haunted_houses_controller.py" {13-16}
from pest import controller, get, post, put, delete
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .haunted_houses_repository import HauntedHouse

@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
    """Haunted-houses routes"""

    service: HauntedHousesService  # 游눌 injected
    
    ...

    @post("/")
    def create_house(self, house: HauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Create a new haunted house"""
        return self.service.create_house(house)
```

In order to handle `POST` requests, we use the `@post` decorator. The `create_house`. Our method
receives a `house` argument of type `HauntedHouse` and returns a `HauntedHouse` object.

The `HauntedHouse` object will be deserialized from the request body. Thanks to `Pydantic` and
<FastapiTag/>, it will be automatically validated and converted to a `HauntedHouse` object.

Then we delegate the creation of the haunted house to the service we created earlier and return the
result.

### Update a haunted house

We use the `PUT` HTTP methods when we want to update stuff. Let's create a route for updating
haunted houses.

```python filename="app/haunted_houses/haunted_houses_controller.py" {13-16}
from pest import controller, get, post, put, delete
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .haunted_houses_repository import HauntedHouse

@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
    """Haunted-houses routes"""

    service: HauntedHousesService  # 游눌 injected
    
    ...

    @put("/{house_id}")
    def update_house(self, house_id: int, updated_house: HauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Update an existing haunted house"""
        return self.service.update_house(house_id, updated_house)
```

In this case we expect two arguments: `house_id` and `updated_house`. The `house_id` will be passed
as a path parameter, and the `updated_house` will be deserialized from the request body.

Again, we delegate the actual business logic to the service and return the result, letting 
<PestTag/> and <FastapiTag/> take care of the validation, serialization, etc.

### Delete a haunted house

Finally, we need a route for deleting haunted houses. We use the `DELETE` HTTP method for that.

```python filename="app/haunted_houses/haunted_houses_controller.py" {13-16}
from pest import controller, get, post, put, delete
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .haunted_houses_repository import HauntedHouse

@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
    """Haunted-houses routes"""

    service: HauntedHousesService  # 游눌 injected
    
    ...

    @delete("/{house_id}")
    def delete_house(self, house_id: int) -> None:
        """Delete a haunted house by ID"""
        self.service.delete_house(house_id)
```

There we go! We have all the routes we need to manage haunted houses.

### The entire controller

At this point, our controller should look like this.

```python filename="app/haunted_houses/haunted_houses_controller.py"
from pest import controller, get, post, put, delete
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .haunted_houses_repository import HauntedHouse

@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
    """Haunted-houses routes"""
    service: HauntedHousesService  # 游눌 injected

    @get("/")
    def get_houses(self) -> list[HauntedHouse]:
        """Get all haunted houses"""
        return self.service.get_houses()

    @get("/{house_id}")
    def get_house_by_id(self, house_id: int) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Get a haunted house by ID"""
        return self.service.get_house_by_id(house_id)

    @post("/")
    def create_house(self, house: HauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Create a new haunted house"""
        return self.service.create_house(house)

    @put("/{house_id}")
    def update_house(self, house_id: int, updated_house: HauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Update an existing haunted house"""
        return self.service.update_house(house_id, updated_house)

    @delete("/{house_id}")
    def delete_house(self, house_id: int) -> None:
        """Delete a haunted house by ID"""
        self.service.delete_house(house_id)
```

All the CRUD operations for haunted houses are now implemented. Let's try them out!

In order to test the routes with methods other than `GET`, we need a tool that allows us to make
requests with different HTTP methods. We can use `curl` for that, but if you want a more user
friendly tool, I recommend [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or the 
[Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.io/) extension for VSCode. There are many other tools
out there, so feel free to use whatever you like.


## Conclusion

In this section, we learned how to create a controller class and define routes for handling HTTP
requests. We also learned how to inject dependencies into the controller class and why it is a good
practice to delegate the business logic to a service class.
