# The Controller Layer

This section explores the creation of the `HauntedHousesController` class, a pivotal component in
any `pest` API. The controller is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and generating 
appropriate responses. It defines the routes and actions necessary for managing haunted houses.


## HauntedHousesController class

When we first introduced the [Hounted House API](../haunted-house-api), we mentioned that our API
would respond to HTTP requests for managing haunted houses CRUD operations (create, read, update,
delete). 

The `HauntedHousesController` class is where we define these routes and actions.

A Controller is a class decorated with the `@controller` decorator.

The decorator takes at least one argument: the route prefix. This prefix will be prepended to all
the routes defined in the controller.

Each route is defined by a method, also known as a request handler, decorated with one of the HTTP
method decorators: `@get`, `@post`, `@put`, `@delete` provided by <PestTag/>.

<Terminal title="~/haunted-houses">
```bash
‚ùØ touch haunted_houses/houses/haunted_houses_controller.py
```
</Terminal>

Now, let's create the `HauntedHousesController` class in the `haunted_houses_controller.py` file and 
implement our first request handler: a `get_houses` method to handle `GET /haunted-houses` requests.

```python filename="haunted_houses/houses/haunted_houses_controller.py"
from pest import controller, get, post, put, delete
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .repository import HauntedHouse

@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
    """Haunted-houses routes"""

    service: HauntedHousesService  # üíâ injected
    
    @get("/")
    def get_houses(self) -> list[HauntedHouse]:
        """Get all haunted houses"""
        return self.service.get_houses()
```

A lot is going on in this small code snippet, so let's break it down.

```python filename="haunted_houses/houses/haunted_houses_controller.py"
@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
```

By decorating the `HauntedHousesController` class with the `@controller` decorator, we are telling
<PestTag/> that this class serves as a controller, and all the routes defined within it will carry 
the prefix `/haunted-houses`.

```python filename="haunted_houses/houses/haunted_houses_controller.py"
    service: HauntedHousesService  # üíâ injected
```

Within the `HauntedHousesController` class, there's a service `service` attribute of type 
`HauntedHousesService`. It's important to note that we're not creating an instance of the service
class here; instead, we're declaring it as a class attribute. When <PestTag/> initializes the
controller, it will automatically instantiate the required service and inject it into the 
controller.


```python filename="haunted_houses/houses/haunted_houses_controller.py"
    @get("/")
    def get_houses(self) -> list[HauntedHouse]:
        """Get all haunted houses"""
        return self.service.get_houses()
```

- The `get_houses` method is decorated with the `@get("/")` decorator, indicating <PestTag/> that
  this method will handle `GET` requests to the root `/haunted-houses` route.

- The docstring of the method will be used as the description of the route in the OpenAPI schema.

- The method returns a list of `HauntedHouse` objects; but since `HauntedHouse` is a pydantic model,
  and <PestTag/> is built on top of <FastapiTag/>, the response is automatically serialized to JSON.

- Typically, we keep controller methods simple, focusing on transport-layer logic like parsing the
  request and validating it. Business logic is often delegated to a service class. In this case,
  we call the `get_houses` method of the `HauntedHousesService` class and return the result. While
  not mandatory, it's a good practice to maintain simplicity in controller methods.

  Controllers ideally handle transport-layer-related tasks such as request parsing, validation, and
  data transformation. <PestTag/> and <FastapiTag/> streamline many of these processes before
  reaching our handler and after the handler returns.

### Let's test it!

Before proceeding with the implementation of the rest of the controller, it's time to test what we
have so far.

In order to do so, we need to revisit the `HauntedHousesModule` class again, and include the
controller class in the `controllers` list. This step ensures that the controller is registered
within the module, allowing <PestTag/> to discover it.

```python filename="haunted_houses/houses/haunted_houses_module.py" {2,7}
from pest import module
from .haunted_houses_controller import HauntedHousesController
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .repository import HauntedHousesRepository

@module(
    controllers=[HauntedHousesController],
    providers=[HauntedHousesService, HauntedHousesRepository],
)
class HauntedHousesModule:
    pass
```

With the controller now registered, it's time to test our route. Start the server and make a request
to the `/haunted-houses` route.

<Terminal title="~/haunted-houses">
```bash
‚ùØ uvicorn haunted_houses.main:app --reload
```
</Terminal>

Open your browser or use a tool like curl, postman, etc. to send a **GET** request:

<Request method="GET" url="http://localhost:8000/haunted-houses/">
<Request.Response code={200}>
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Spooky Manor",
    "ghost_count": 5
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Eerie Estate",
    "ghost_count": 3
  }
]
```
</Request.Response>
</Request>

If everything went well, you should see the list of our haunted houses in the response as a JSON 
array. Hurrah! We have our first route up and running!


## Define the rest of the request handlers (or routes)

Now that we know how to define a route, let's define the rest of the routes for managing all the
CRUD operations for haunted houses.

### Get a haunted house by id

```python filename="haunted_houses/houses/haunted_houses_controller.py" {13-16}
from pest import controller, get, post, put, delete
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .repository import HauntedHouse

@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
    """Haunted-houses routes"""

    service: HauntedHousesService  # üíâ injected
    
    ...

    @get("/{house_id}")
    def get_house_by_id(self, house_id: int) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Get a haunted house by ID"""
        return self.service.get_house_by_id(house_id)
```

Similar to the previous route, the only difference this time is the addition of a path parameter:
`/{house_id}`. This parameter will be passed as an argument to the `get_house_by_id` method.

For instance, when the route `/haunted-houses/1` is requested, the `get_house_by_id` method will 
receive a` house_id` argument with the value `1`. Using our service instance, we retrieve the 
haunted house by its ID and return it.

Let's test it!

<Request method="GET" url="http://localhost:8000/haunted-houses/1">
<Request.Response code={200}>
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Spooky Manor",
  "ghost_count": 5
}
```
</Request.Response>
</Request>

### Create a haunted house

When it comes to creating entities, the `POST` HTTP method is commonly used. Let's create a route
and a request handler for creating haunted houses.

```python filename="haunted_houses/houses/haunted_houses_controller.py" {13-16}
from pest import controller, get, post, put, delete
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .repository import HauntedHouse

@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
    """Haunted-houses routes"""

    service: HauntedHousesService  # üíâ injected
    
    ...

    @post("/")
    def create_house(self, house: HauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Create a new haunted house"""
        return self.service.create_house(house)
```

In order to handle `POST` requests, we use the `@post` decorator. The `create_house` method takes a
house argument of type `HauntedHouse` and returns a `HauntedHouse` object.

The `HauntedHouse` object is automatically deserialized from the request body, validated, and 
converted to a Python object, thanks to the power of `Pydantic` and <FastapiTag/>. We then delegate
the actual creation of the haunted house to the previously defined service and return the result.

Time to give it a try!

<Request method="POST" url="http://localhost:8000/haunted-houses/">
<Request.Body>
```json
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Creepy Cottage",
    "ghost_count": 8
}
```
</Request.Body>
<Request.Response code={200}>
```json
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Creepy Cottage",
    "ghost_count": 8
}
```
</Request.Response>
</Request>

Nice! Apparently, our haunted house was successfully created. Let's check if it's in the list of
haunted houses by making a `GET` request to the `/haunted-houses` route.

<Request method="GET" url="http://localhost:8000/haunted-houses/">
<Request.Response code={200}>
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Spooky Manor",
    "ghost_count": 5
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Eerie Estate",
    "ghost_count": 3
  }
]
```
</Request.Response>
</Request>

Oh no! It looks like our new haunted house was not saved üò¢

#### What's going on here?

By default, <PestTag/> registers all providers with a transient 
[scope](/docs/overview/providers#scopes). 
This means that a new instance of the provider is created every time it's injected into a controller
or another provider.

That's the case of our `HauntedHousesRepository` class. Every time the `HauntedHousesService` class
is instantiated, a new instance of the `HauntedHousesRepository` class is created and injected into
the service. This behavior might be desirable in most cases, but not in this one because we want to
keep the list of haunted houses in memory.

Let's change the scope of the `HauntedHousesRepository` class to a singleton. This way, only one
instance of the repository will be created and shared across the application.

```python filename="haunted_houses/houses/haunted_houses_module.py" {2,13-16}
from pest import module
from pest.metadata.types.module_meta import ValueProvider

from .haunted_houses_controller import HauntedHousesController
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .repository import HauntedHousesRepository


@module(
    controllers=[HauntedHousesController],
    providers=[
        HauntedHousesService,
        ValueProvider(
            provide=HauntedHousesRepository,
            use_value=HauntedHousesRepository(),
        ),
    ],
)
class HauntedHousesModule:
    pass
```

Now, instead of registering the `HauntedHousesRepository` class, we register a `ValueProvider` with
a specific instance of the repository. This way, the same instance of the repository will be shared
across the application.

Now if we create our haunted house again and then try to retrieve the list of haunted houses, we
should see our new haunted house in the list:

<Request method="GET" url="http://localhost:8000/haunted-houses/">
<Request.Response code={200}>
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Spooky Manor",
    "ghost_count": 5
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Eerie Estate",
    "ghost_count": 3
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Creepy Cottage",
    "ghost_count": 8
  }
]
```
</Request.Response>
</Request>

Beautiful! üçæ

### Update a haunted house

When it comes to updating entities, we utilize the `PUT` HTTP method. Let's create a route for
updating haunted houses.

```python filename="haunted_houses/houses/haunted_houses_controller.py" {13-16}
from pest import controller, get, post, put, delete
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .repository import HauntedHouse

@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
    """Haunted-houses routes"""

    service: HauntedHousesService  # üíâ injected
    
    ...

    @put("/{house_id}")
    def update_house(self, house_id: int, updated_house: HauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Update an existing haunted house"""
        return self.service.update_house(house_id, updated_house)
```

Here, we define a route for updating haunted houses using the `@put` decorator. The `update_house`
method expects two arguments: `house_id` as a path parameter, and `updated_house`, which is
deserialized from the request body.

> If you come from <FastapiTag/>, you might find this quite familiar. <PestTag/> is built on top of
> <FastapiTag/>, so it inherits many of its features. Importantly, <PestTag/> request handlers are,
> essentially, <FastapiTag/> routes in the background. This means that everything you can do with
> <FastapiTag/>, you can seamlessly achieve with <PestTag/> handlers. For example, you can leverage
> <FastapiTag/>'s powerful features for handling body parameters, request validation, and more. 
> Refer to the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for detailed insights on
> utilizing these capabilities.

The business logic for the update is delegated to the service, and the result is returned. As
before, <PestTag/> and <FastapiTag/> handle tasks like validation and serialization seamlessly.


Apparently, we found 2 more ghosts in our `Spooky Manor` haunted house. Let's update it!

<Request method="PUT" url="http://localhost:8000/haunted-houses/3">
<Request.Body>
```json
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Spooky Manor",
    "ghost_count": 7
}
```
</Request.Body>
<Request.Response code={200}>
```json
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Spooky Manor",
    "ghost_count": 7
}
```
</Request.Response>
</Request>

### Delete a haunted house

Finally, we need a route for deleting haunted houses (once all the ghosts are gone, of course üòõ).
We use the `DELETE` HTTP method for that.

```python filename="haunted_houses/houses/haunted_houses_controller.py" {13-16}
from pest import controller, get, post, put, delete
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .repository import HauntedHouse

@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
    """Haunted-houses routes"""

    service: HauntedHousesService  # üíâ injected
    
    ...

    @delete("/{house_id}")
    def delete_house(self, house_id: int) -> None:
        """Delete a haunted house by ID"""
        self.service.delete_house(house_id)
```

If we send a `DELETE` request to the `/haunted-houses/1` route, the `delete_house` method will be
called with the `house_id` argument set to `1`. The service will then communicate with the
repository to delete the haunted house.

Let's try it out!

<Request method="DELETE" url="http://localhost:8000/haunted-houses/3">
<Request.Response code={200}>
</Request.Response>
</Request>

If we try to retrieve the list of haunted houses again, we should see that the `Spooky Manor` is 
gone with all its ghosts üëª

There we go! We have all the routes we need to manage haunted houses.

### The entire controller

At this point, our controller should look like this.

```python filename="haunted_houses/houses/haunted_houses_controller.py"
from pest import controller, get, post, put, delete
from .haunted_houses_service import HauntedHousesService
from .repository import HauntedHouse

@controller("/haunted-houses")
class HauntedHousesController:
    """Haunted-houses routes"""
    service: HauntedHousesService  # üíâ injected

    @get("/")
    def get_houses(self) -> list[HauntedHouse]:
        """Get all haunted houses"""
        return self.service.get_houses()

    @get("/{house_id}")
    def get_house_by_id(self, house_id: int) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Get a haunted house by ID"""
        return self.service.get_house_by_id(house_id)

    @post("/")
    def create_house(self, house: HauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Create a new haunted house"""
        return self.service.create_house(house)

    @put("/{house_id}")
    def update_house(self, house_id: int, updated_house: HauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Update an existing haunted house"""
        return self.service.update_house(house_id, updated_house)

    @delete("/{house_id}")
    def delete_house(self, house_id: int) -> None:
        """Delete a haunted house by ID"""
        self.service.delete_house(house_id)
```

All the CRUD operations for haunted houses are now implemented. Yay! üéâ

## Conclusion

Across this course, we've explored the core concepts of creating APIs with the `pest` framework. 
From crafting controller classes to defining routes and handling HTTP requests, we've covered the
essential aspects of API development with `pest`.

Our exploration included insights into dependency injection and the importance of delegating
business logic to a service. These practices not only enhance modularity but also contribute to the
maintainability of our API.

In the upcoming courses, we'll dive into more advanced features like authentication, authorization,
testing, and more! Stay tuned!
