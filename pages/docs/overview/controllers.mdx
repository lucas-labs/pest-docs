# Controllers

Controllers have the responsability of receiving requests and sending appropriate responses.

Each controller handles incoming requests for a specific route path and its subpaths by defining
different request handlers.

```python
from pest.decorators import controller, post, get

@controller("/rat")
class RatController:
    @get("/{id}")
    def get_one(self, id: int):
        return {
            "id": id,
            "name": "Rattata"
        }
```

The `@controller` decorator takes, at a minimum, a path as an argument. This path will be used as
the base path for all the request handlers defined in the controller.

The `@get` http request method decorator tells <PestTag/> that the decorated method should be used to
handle `GET` requests to the path defined in the decorator's argument. In this case, the `get_one`
method will handle `GET` requests to `/rat/{id}` and return a JSON response with the `id` and `name`
of the requested object.

Now, we tipically would have more than one handler for a given path. Appart from getting a single
`rat`, we might want our API to expose a way to create new `rats`. We can do that by adding a new
method to the controller and decorating it with the `@post` decorator.

```python {13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20}
from pest.decorators import controller, post, get
from .dtos import RatCreateDTO

@controller("/rat")
class RatController:
    @get("/{id}")
    def get_one(self, id: int):
        return {
            "id": id,
            "name": "Rattata"
        }

    @post("/")
    def create(self, new_rat: RatCreateDTO):
        # create a new rat

        return {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Speedy Gonzales"
        }
```

Our `create` method now gives the controller the ability to handle `POST` requests to `/rat/`.

The available http method decorators are:

-   `@get`
-   `@post`
-   `@put`
-   `@patch`
-   `@delete`

Each of them handles will receive requests with the corresponding http method to the provided path.
