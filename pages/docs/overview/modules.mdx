# Modules

A module is a class decorated with `@module` decorator. They are used to organize the application
grouping related resources that provide a distinct business value together into reusable
self-contained units.

<InfoBox title="ðŸ‘‹ @module has an alias">
    In the python world, the word "**module**" is often used to refer to a python file. As this 
    library took inspiration from <NestjsTag/>, we decided to use the word *module* anyway, but
    we also added some aliases, just in case you prefer to use a different word to refer to the
    same concept and avoid confusion.

    All the following decorators are equivalent:

    - `@module`
    - `@domain`
    - `@dom`

    We took the word *domain* from 
    [DDD (Domain Driven Design)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design). In DDD, a 
    domain is collection of closely related concepts that have a clear business value.

All <PestTag /> applications have at least one module, the **root module**. The root module is the
starting point of the application and it's used by `pest` to build the application dependency graph.
The dependency graph is a collection of internal metadata that tells `pest` how to build
and organize the application.

Nevertheless, `pest` aims at mid to large scale APIs, so most applications will tipically
have more than one module, each of them containing and encapsulating closely related components
and services that when put together provides a distinct **business value** to the application.

<InfoBox title="ðŸ‘‹ Tip: You can actually see the dependency graph!">
    If you print the string representation of your application instance, you will see how `pest` 
    created the dependency graph of your application as an actual ascii graph.

    ```python
    >>> from pest import Pest
    >>> from .app_module import AppModule
    >>> app = Pest.create(AppModule)
    >>> print(app)
    AppModule
        â”‚
        â”œâ”€ AuthModule
        â”‚   â”‚ â—‹ AuthService
        â”‚   â”‚ â–¡ AuthController
        â”‚
        â”œâ”€ HauntedHouseModule
            â”‚ â—‹ HauntedHouseService
            â”‚ â–¡ HauntedHouseController
    ```
</InfoBox>

```python filename="haunted_house_module.py"
from pest import module
from .haunted_house_controller import HauntedHouseController

@module(
    controllers=[HauntedHouseController],
    providers=[HauntedHouseService],
)
class HauntedHouseModule:
    pass
```

## The `@module` decorator

The `@module` decorator can take the following arguments:

<Table
    rows={[
        [
            { content: 'imports', className: 'font-mono text-orange-400' },
            {
                content: <>
                    A list of imported modules that export the providers which are required in this
                    module.
                </>,
            },
        ],
        [
            { content: 'providers', className: 'font-mono text-orange-400' },
            {
                content: <>
                    The providers that will be contained and can be <i>injected</i> for other 
                    componentsin the module. Also called <b>dependencies</b> or <b>services</b>.
                </>,
            },
        ],
        [
            { content: 'exports', className: 'font-mono text-orange-400' },
            {
                content: <>
                    The providers that will be <i>exported</i> and can be <i>injected</i> for other
                    modules that import this module. They can be a subset of the providers in 
                    the <code>providers</code> list. This means that <code>exports</code> define
                    the <b>public interface</b> of the module.
                </>,
            },
        ],
        [
            { content: 'controllers', className: 'font-mono text-orange-400' },
            { content: 'The controllers that will be contained in the module.' },
        ]
    ]}
/>


## Feature modules

A feature module organizes different pieces of the application that are closely related and
belongs to a specific domain.

When applications grow, it's common to have a lot of different components and services that
are not closely related to each other. That's when applying the **separation of concerns** principle
by creating feature modules containing related components and services becomes handy and helps
to keep the application organized and maintainable over time.


Feature modules are just regular modules, but they are usually created in a different directory
and are imported by the root module or other feature modules using the `imports` argument of the
`@module` decorator.

Let's say we have some authentication related components and services that we want to group
together in a feature module:

```python filename="auth_module.py"
from pest import module

@module(
    providers=[AuthService, AndOtherServices, RelatedToAuth],
    exports=[AuthService], # we export the AuthService so other modules importing this
                           # feature module can use it as a dependency
)
class AuthModule:
    pass
```

Notice that we are only exporting the `AuthService`. Using the `exports` argument of the
`@module` decorator we can define the **public interface** of the module, that is, the
providers that will be available for other modules that import this one.

Now we can import the `AuthModule` in the root module or any other feature module that needs
to use the `AuthService`:

```python filename="app_module.py"
from pest import module

@module(
    imports=[AuthModule, HauntedHouseModule], # we import the feature modules we want to use
    providers=[AppService],
    controllers=[AppController],
)
class AppModule:
    pass
```

This way, `AuthService` is available for the modules that import the `AuthModule` (or by
all of them, if it's imported by the root module)

This allows us to create **isolated** and self-contained feature modules that can be imported by
others while, at the same time, keeping the **public interface** of the module clear and explicit.

This opens the door to create **reusable** feature modules that can even be its own package,
published and developed independently from the rest of the application (even by a different team),
making our feature modules completely
[encapsulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)).
