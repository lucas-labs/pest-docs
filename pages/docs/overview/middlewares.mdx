# Middlewares

A middleware is a function that executes before the request is handled by the controller and before
the response is sent back to the client.

It acts as a *man-in-the-middle* between the request and the response. It can be used to perform
a wide variety of tasks, such as:

- Logging
- Authentication and authorization
- Error handling
- Request validation
- Rate limiting
- CORS
- Caching
- Compression
- etc.

In short, a middleware works like this:

1. It receives every request before it is handled by the controller.
2. It performs the required tasks.
3. It passes the request to the next handler in the chain (it could be another middleware or the
   final controller).
4. It receives the response from the next handler in the chain.
5. It can do something with the response before sending it back to the client.
6. It sends the response back to the client.

<InfoBox title="游뱂 Note: pest is compatible with any ASGI middleware">
    <PestTag to='/'/> is built on top of <FastapiTag/>, which, in turn, is built on 
    <StarletteTag>Starlette's</StarletteTag> ASGI implementation. 

    This means that any ASGI middleware out there can be used with `pest`, included those provided
    by both Starlette and FastAPI.

    You can read a lot more about middlewares on both Starlette's and FastAPI's documentation:

    - [FastAPI's Middlewares](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/middleware/)

## Creating a Middleware

<PestTag/> support different ways of creating middlewares:

1. As a `function`,
2. As a `class`,
3. As a `Callable` instance,
4. As a pure `ASGI` middleware

### Functional Middleware

At a very basic level, a middleware is just a function that receives a `request` and a `call_next`
parameter and returns a `response`.

The `request` parameter is the incoming request that will be handled by the controller. The
`call_next` parameter is an asynchronous function that, when awaited,  will call the next handler 
in the request processing chain.

Let's see an example:


```python
from pest import Request, Response
from pest.middleware import CallNext

async def request_identifier(
    request: Request,
    call_next: CallNext,
) -> Response:
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers['X-Request-Id'] = uuid.uuid4()
    return response    
```

The `request_identifier` middleware receives every request and adds a `X-Request-Id` header to it
with a random UUID before passing it to the next handler.

### `PestMiddleware`

You can also create a middleware by extending the `PestMiddleware` class.

<Callout emoji="游녦" type="info">
    If you come from the node.js world, you might find this approach more familiar.
</Callout>

```python
from pest import Request, Response
from pest.middleware import CallNext, PestMiddleware

class RequestIdentifier(PestMiddleware):
    async def use(self, request: Request, call_next: CallNext) -> Response:
        """
        Middleware that adds a 'X-Request-Id' header to the incoming request.
        """
        response = await call_next(request)
        response.headers['X-Request-Id'] = uuid.uuid4()
        return response 
```

### Callable instance Middleware

You can also create a middleware by implementing the `__call__` method in a class.

```python
from pest import Request, Response
from pest.middleware import CallNext, PestMiddlewareCallback

class RequestIdentifier(PestMiddlewareCallback):
    async def __call__(self, request: Request, call_next: CallNext) -> Response:
        response = await call_next(request)
        response.headers['X-Request-Id'] = uuid.uuid4()
        return response 
```

They are essentially the same as functional middlewares, but they allow you to use class attributes
and to control its initialization.

Extending the `PestMiddlewareCallback` Protocol is optional.


### ASGI Middleware

As we mentioned before, <PestTag/> is built on top of <FastapiTag/>, which at the same time is 
built on top of <StarletteTag>Starlette</StarletteTag> ASGI implementation.

This means that any ASGI middleware out there can be used with <PestTag noicon/>:

```python
from starlette.types import ASGIApp, Message, Receive, Scope, Send

class PureASGIRequestIdentifier:
    """
    ASGI middleware that adds a 'X-Request-Id' header to the HTTP response.
    """

    def __init__(self, app: ASGIApp) -> None:
        self.app = app

    async def __call__(self, scope: Scope, receive: Receive, send: Send) -> None:
        if scope['type'] != 'http':
            return await self.app(scope, receive, send)

        async def send_wrapper(message: Message) -> None:
            if message['type'] == 'http.response.start':
                headers = MutableHeaders(scope=message)
                headers.append('X-Request-Id', uuid.uuid4())
            await send(message)

        await self.app(scope, receive, send_wrapper)
```

## Dependency Injection

Functional, class and callable instance middlewares can also have dependencies injected into them.


### Functional Middleware

```python
from pest import Request, Response
from pest.middleware import CallNext, inject
from services.identity import IdentityService

async def request_identifier(
    request: Request,
    call_next: CallNext,
    identity_svc: IdentityService = inject(),  # 游눌 injected
) -> Response:
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers['X-Request-Id'] = identity_svc.make_request_id()
    return response
```

For functional middlewares, the dependencies are injected as function parameters. 

If you are using type checking you will need to import the `inject` function from the <PestTag/>
module and assign it to the parameter you want to inject.

The `inject` function is just a helper to initialize the parameter so that the function can still
respect the `Callable[[Request, CallNext], Response]` signature.

### `PestMiddleware`

For `PestMiddleware` middlewares, the dependencies are injected as class attributes or constructor
parameters. Here you don't need to import the `inject` function.

```python
from pest import Request, Response
from pest.middleware import CallNext, PestMiddleware

class RequestIdentifier(PestMiddleware):
    identity_svc: IdentityService  # 游눌 injected

    async def use(self, request: Request, call_next: CallNext) -> Response:
        response = await call_next(request)
        response.headers['X-Request-Id'] = self.identity_svc.make_request_id()
        return response
```

### Callable instance Middleware

The same applies to callable instance middlewares.

```python
from pest import Request, Response
from pest.middleware import CallNext, PestMiddlwareCallback

class RequestIdentifier(PestMiddlwareCallback):
    identity_svc: IdentityService  # 游눌 injected

    async def __call__(self, request: Request, call_next: CallNext) -> Response:
        response = await call_next(request)
        response.headers['X-Request-Id'] = self.identity_svc.make_request_id()
        return response 
```

### ASGI Middleware

Dependency injection for ASGI middlewares is not (yet) supported.

## Registering a Middleware

Once you have created your middleware, you need to register it.

You can do that when you create your application instance, by passing the middleware to the
`middleware` argument of the `Pest.create` method.


```python
from pest import Pest

app = Pest.create(
    AppModule,
    middleware=[request_identifier],
)
```

The `middleware` argument takes a list of middlewares. You can register as many middlewares as you
want. It can be a mix of functional, class, callable instance and ASGI middlewares.

For `Callable` instances and `PestMiddlware`, you have two options: you can either pass the class 
itself or an instance of the class provided by you.

If you provide an instance, you are responsible for initializing it. Meaning that you are the
responsable for injecting the dependencies into the instance.

For ASGI middlewares, you need to use the `Middleware` class provided by starlette.

```python
from pest import Pest
from starlette.middleware import Middleware

app = Pest.create(
    AppModule,
    middleware=[
        Middleware(PureASGIRequestIdentifier),
    ],
)
```

You can read more about the `Middleware` class in the 
<StarletteTag to='middleware'>Starlette's documentation</StarletteTag>


### <FastapiTag iconClassName="h-[24px]">FastAPI</FastapiTag> is still there!

If you are familiar with FastAPI, you might be wondering where is the `app.middleware` decorator.
Well, it's still there as any other FastAPI and Starlette functionality. So, registering a
middleware this way is still possible:

```python
@app.middleware('http')
async def request_identifier(
    request: Request,
    call_next: CallNext,
    identity_svc: IdentityService,  # 游눌 injection is supported here as well!
) -> Response:
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers['X-Request-Id'] = identity_svc.make_request_id()
    return response
```
