# Providers

Providers are classes or objects that can be injected into other components.

They're also referred to as **dependencies** or **services**. They could be anything, from simple
helper classes to complex services responsible for executing the main business logic of the
application, performing database queries, making HTTP requests. A service could also be a 
database connection, a logger, a cache, a mailer, etc.

Providers are defined in the `providers` list of the `@module` decorator and can be injected
into other components, such as controllers, other providers, middlewares, etc.

For example, let's say we have a `HauntedHouseService` that is responsible for handling all the
business logic and database operations related to `HauntedHouse` entities.

It could look something like this:


```python filename="haunted_house_service.py"
from pest import module, inject
from sqlmodel import Session, select
from .models.haunted_house import HauntedHouse

class HauntedHouseService:
    db: Session  # 游눌 automatically injected

    def get_all(self) -> list[HauntedHouse]:
        """Returns all the haunted houses"""

        return session.exec(select(HauntedHouse)).all()

    def get_by_id(self, id: int) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Returns a haunted house by its id"""

        return session.exec(select(HauntedHouse).where(HauntedHouse.id == id)).first()

    def new(self, haunted_house: NewHauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse:
        """Creates a new haunted house"""

        new_haunted_house = HauntedHouse(**haunted_house.dict())
        session.add(new_haunted_house)
        session.commit()
        session.refresh(new_haunted_house)
        return new_haunted_house
```

When we define a provider and make it available in the module, we can then inject it into other
components, such as controllers, other providers, middlewares, etc.

If we remember from the <Link href="./controllers">Controllers</Link> section, we had a
`HauntedHouseController` that was using a `HauntedHouseService` to handle incoming requests.


```python filename="haunted_house_controller.py"
@controller("/haunted-house")
class HauntedHouseController:
    service: HauntedHouseService  # 游눌 automatically injected

    @get("/")
    def get_all(self) -> list[HauntedHouse]:
        return self.service.get_all()

    ... other handlers ...
```

The `HauntedHouseController` handles the incoming requests and delegates the actual business logic
to the `HauntedHouseService` who knows how to talk to the database and perform the required
operations. 

The `HauntedHouseService` is injected into the controller by <PestTag/> when the controller is created.
This is done automatically by reading the type annotations of the controller's constructor and
class attributes (as in the case above).

If we inspect the `HauntedHouseService` class, we can see that it has a `db` session attribute.
You can have services that depend on other providers and so on. `pest` will automatically inject
all the required dependencies.

## Declaring Providers

Providers are declared in the `providers` list of the `@module` decorator.

```python filename="haunted_house_module.py"
from pest import module, inject

from .controllers.haunted_house_controller import HauntedHouseController
from .services.haunted_house_service import HauntedHouseService

@module(
    controllers=[HauntedHouseController],
    providers=[HauntedHouseService], # by declaring the provider here, 
                                     # we make it available to all components in
                                     # the module
)
class HauntedHouseModule:
    pass
```



## Dependency Injection

Let's talk a bit more about dependency injection. 

<InfoBox title="游뱂 Note: nest uses rodi as its container">
    Under the hood, <PestTag to={'/'}/> uses [`rodi`](https://github.com/Neoteroi/rodi); a dependency injection 
    library for Python.
</InfoBox>

Nest was built with dependency injection in mind. It's a powerful design pattern that allows us to
write loosely coupled code that is easier to test and maintain.

All dependency injection systems contain two main parts:

- A **provider registry**, also called a *container*, that holds all the providers and their dependencies.

- A **consumer**, or *dependent*, which gets injected with the required dependencies.

There are different approachs in how to inject dependencies into consumers (in other words, how the
consumer tells the container what dependencies it needs and how the container provides them).

- *Constructor* injection

- *Property* injection

<PestTag/> supports both of them thanks to [`rodi`](https://github.com/Neoteroi/rodi). 
Let's see how that works.

### Constructor Injection

Constructor injection means that the dependencies are injected into the consumer's constructor.

```python
class HauntedHouseController:
    def __init__(self, service: HauntedHouseService): 
        self.service = service # 游눌 injected

    ...
```

In the example above, the `HauntedHouseController` class has a constructor that takes a 
`HauntedHouseService` as an argument. This means that the controller depends on the service to
work. By declaring the dependency in the constructor, the controller is telling `pest` that it
needs a `HauntedHouseService` to work.

When the controller is created, <PestTag/> will automatically inject the required dependencies into
the constructor by its type annotations.

### Property Injection

Property injection means that the dependencies are injected into the consumer's properties or
attributes.

```python
class HauntedHouseController:
    service: HauntedHouseService  # 游눌 injected

    ...
```

In the example above, the `HauntedHouseController` class has a `service` attribute of type
`HauntedHouseService`. This means that the controller depends on the service to work. <PestTag/>
will automatically inject the required dependencies into the controller's attributes by its type
annotations.

## Scopes

Scopes defines the lifetime of a provider: how long an instance of a provider will live in the 
container.

`pest` supports the following scopes:

<Table
    rows={[
        [
            { content: 'Singleton', className: 'font-mono text-orange-400' },
            {
                content: <>
                    A singleton provider will be created only once and the same instance will be
                    injected into all the consumers that depend on it. It doesn't matter how many
                    times the provider is injected, it will always be the same instance.
                </>
            },
        ],
        [
            { content: 'Transient', className: 'font-mono text-orange-400' },
            {
                content: <>
                    A new instance of a transient provider will be created every time it's injected
                    into a consumer. This means that every consumer that depends on a transient
                    provider will receive a different instance of the provider.
                </>
            },            
        ],
        [
            { content: 'Scoped/Request', className: 'font-mono text-orange-400' },
            {
                content: <>
                    A scoped provider will be created once per request. This means that every
                    consumer that depends on a scoped provider will receive the same instance of
                    the provider for the duration of the request. Once the request is finished, the
                    provider will be disposed.
                </>
            },            
        ]
    ]}
/>

By deafult, all providers declared in the `providers` list of the `@module` decorator are
*Transient* instances.
