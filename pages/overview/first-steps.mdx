# First steps

In this section we will go through the basic steps to get started with <PestTag />.

## Installation

<PestTag/> is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pest-core/), allowing you to install it
with `pip`:

```bash
pip install pest-core
```

## Setting up a project

One of <PestTag /> main goals is to assist you in organizing mid-sized to large web API projects
conveniently.

Drawing inspiration from philosophies like
[MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) and
[DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), <PestTag /> provides a set of components
that you can leverage to build and structure your project.

### Example project structure

A <PestTag /> app might look something like this:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="modules" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="auth" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name="auth_controller.py" />
                <FileTree.File name="auth_service.py" />
                <FileTree.File name="auth_module.py" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
            <FileTree.Folder name="haunted_house" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name="haunted_house_controller.py" />
                <FileTree.File name="haunted_house_service.py" />
                <FileTree.File name="haunted_house_module.py" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.File name="app_module.py" />
        <FileTree.File name="main.py" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

    If you're comming from a **nestjs** background, you might found this kind of structure
    familiar.

### Overview of the components

Let's take a look at some of the different components that can make up a <PestTag /> app. In the 
next chapters, we will delve into each of them in detail. This is just a quick overview to give you
a general idea of how they all work together.

<Table
    headers={[{ content: 'Component' }, { content: 'Description' }]}
    rows={[
        [
            { content: 'main.py', className: 'font-mono text-orange-400' },
            {
                content: `The entry point of your application. 
                        It instantiates the app and all its modules`,
            },
        ],
        [
            { content: 'app_module.py', className: 'font-mono text-orange-400' },
            {
                content: `The main module of your application. 
                        It imports all the other modules and registers them in the app`,
            },
        ],
        [
            { content: '*_module.py', className: 'font-mono text-orange-400' },
            {
                content: `Modules are the building blocks of your application. 
                        They are responsible for registering controllers and services`,
            },
        ],
        [
            { content: '*_controller.py', className: 'font-mono text-orange-400' },
            {
                content: `Controllers are responsible for handling requests and returning
                        responses. They are registered in modules and can be injected with 
                        services and providers. Each controller is associated with a route path and
                        defines different methods for handling requests made to that route or to its
                        sub-routes.`,
            },
        ],
        [
            { content: '*_service.py', className: 'font-mono text-orange-400' },
            {
                content: `Services define the business logic of your application. 
                        They are registered in modules and can be injected in routes, other services
                        and middlewares.`,
            },
        ],
    ]}
/>

#### The `main.py` file

The `main.py` file serves as the entry point for your application. It instantiates the app from a 
root module and a set of optional configuration parameters.

```python filename="main.py"
from pest import Pest
from .app_module import AppModule

# initialize the application using AppModule as the root module
app = Pest.create(AppModule)
```

We utilize the `Pest.create` method to create an instance of the `PestApplication`.

`PestApplication` is a subclass of `FastAPI`. Consequently, anything achievable with a `FastAPI` 
app is also possible with a `PestApplication`.

To start your application with [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/), you can use the following
command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

#### The `app_module.py` file

The `app_module.py` file functions as the main module of your application.Typically, it imports all
the other modules (also referred to as Feature Modules) and registers them in the app.

```python filename="app_module.py"
from pest.decorators import module

from .modules.auth.auth_module import AuthModule
from .modules.haunted_house.haunted_house_module import HauntedHouseModule

@module(
    imports=[
        AuthModule,
        HauntedHouseModule
    ],
)
class AppModule:
    pass
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    The `@module` decorator marks a class as a module and accepts parameters that define its
    behavior. In this case, we use the `imports` parameter to specify which modules should be 
    imported by this one.
</Callout>

#### Feature Modules

Feature modules are responsible for registering **controllers** and **services** specific to a
particular business domain within your application.

For instance, let's consider an `auth` module responsible for managing all authentication-related 
logic. The module might look like this:

```python filename="auth_module.py"
from pest.decorators import module
from .auth_controller import AuthController
from .auth_service import AuthService

@module(
    controllers=[AuthController],
    providers=[AuthService]
)
class AuthModule:
    pass
```

The `AuthModule` registers:

-   `AuthController` as a _controller_. This one will be responsible for handling requests to the 
    `/auth` route and its sub-routes. It collaborates with the `AuthService` to execute the 
    necessary business logic.

-   `AuthService` as a _provider_, managing all business logic related to authentication.

In this context, a `Controller` represents a group of related route handlers, processing requests
to the same "parent" route of the `Controller`.

In the example above, we can envision `AuthController` as a collection of route handlers processing
all incoming requests to the `/auth` route and its sub-routes.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    As you can observe, there isn't much distinction between a feature module and the main module; 
    they are essentially the same. The primary dissimilarity lies in the fact that the main module 
    is the first one to be loaded by the app, serving as the top of the module hierarchy.
</Callout>

#### Controllers

Controllers handle requests and return responses. They are registered in modules and can be injected
with services and providers. Each controller is associated with a route path and defines different 
methods for handling requests made to that route or its sub-routes.

```python filename="haunted_house_controller.py"
from pest import controller, post, get
from .haunted_house_service import HauntedHouseService

@controller("/haunted-house")
class HauntedHouseController:
    service: HauntedHouseService  # 💉 automatically injected

    @get("/")
    def get_all(self) -> list[HauntedHouse]:
        return self.service.get_all()

    @get("/{id}")
    def get(self, id: int) -> HauntedHouse:
        return self.service.get_by_id(id)

    @post("/")
    def create(self, haunted_house: NewHauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse:
        return self.service.new(haunted_house)
```

This controller manages all requests made to the `/haunted-house` route and its sub-routes. 
It collaborates with the `HauntedHouseService` to execute the necessary business logic.

Everything that works with `FastAPI` route handlers also applies to <PestTag /> controllers and 
method handlers. This includes:

-   Request and response validation using Pydantic models
-   OpenAPI automatic documentation generation
-   Path, Query, Body, Cookie, Header parameters
-   etc.
