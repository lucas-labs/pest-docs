# Introducing the Haunted Houses API

In this chapter, we'll embark on the journey of building an API for managing haunted houses 
utilizing the <PestTag/> framework.

The Haunted Houses API will offer a set of endpoints to perform common CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
Delete) operations on haunted houses.

For that purpose, we will be using a Feature Module called `HauntedHousesModule` which will contain
all the necessary components to handle the haunted houses functionality in a modular and organized 
manner.

The `HauntedHousesModule` will act as a container for the components that make up the Haunted Houses 
feature, including a controller and a service. This modular approach ensures a clean separation of
concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable.

In the upcoming sections, we'll explore how each component within the `HauntedHousesModule` 
contributes to the functionality of our Haunted Houses API, starting with creating the module itself
and then moving on to the service and controller layers.


## Project Structure

After completing the entire series, the project structure should look something like this:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="hello" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="greeter_service.py" />
            <FileTree.File name="hello_controller.py" />
            <FileTree.File name="module.py" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="haunted_houses" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="haunted_houses_repository.py" />
            <FileTree.File name="haunted_houses_controller.py" />
            <FileTree.File name="haunted_houses_service.py" />
            <FileTree.File name="haunted_houses_module.py" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
