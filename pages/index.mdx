# Introduction

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
    Pest is still in early development, and it's not ready for production yet. If you want to
    help, please, go to <GithubTag>github</GithubTag> and say hello!
</Callout>

**<PestTag/>** is a [python](https://www.python.org/) web application framework  designed for 
constructing scalable APIs, drawing inspiration from <NestjsTag/>.

It is constructed on top of <FastapiTag/> with the goal of offering a straightforward yet robust
interface and framework for developing extensive APIs that can be distributed across multiple files 
and self-contained _modules_.

This framework harnesses the capabilities of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/),
[Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) and [rodi](https://github.com/Neoteroi/rodi) to deliver 
modularized, scalable, and easily creatable APIs, taking inspiration directly from 
[nest.js](https://nestjs.com/).

```python
@controller("/haunted-house")
class HauntedHouseController:
    service: HauntedHouseService  # 💉 automatically injected

    @get("/")
    def get_all(self) -> list[HauntedHouse]:
        return self.service.get_all()

    @get("/{id}")
    def get(self, id: int) -> HauntedHouse:
        return self.service.get_by_id(id)

    @post("/")
    def create(self, haunted_house: NewHauntedHouse) -> HauntedHouse:
        return self.service.new(haunted_house)
```

<Callout emoji="👋" type="info">
    If you come from the node.js world, you can think of **<PestTag/>** as
    <NestjsTag/> meets python.

## Features

-   <Mark>**openapi**</Mark> - `pest` utilizes [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) under the 
    hood, offering all the features provided by it, including its impressive automatic documentation 
    with [openapi](https://swagger.io/specification/) and [redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc)
    UIs.

-   <Mark>**class-based**</Mark> - `pest` employs object-oriented programming (OOP) as an 
    organizational approach for routes, middlewares, and other API components.

-   <Mark>**modularity**</Mark> - `pest` allows you to create `modules`, which are a way to organize
    groups of allowing the organization of interrelated services, routes, and middlewares that 
    provide distinct business value to your API.

-   <Mark>**scalability**</Mark> - `pest` is designed with scalability in mind, targeting mid to 
    large APIs distributed across multiple files organized in different self-contained modules.

-   <Mark>**dependency injection**</Mark> - `pest` uses dependency injection (thanks to the awesome
    [`rodi`](https://github.com/Neoteroi/rodi/tree/main/rodi)) to provide a way to inject 
    dependencies into your services, controllers, routes, middlewares, etc.

-   <Mark>**declarative**</Mark> - `pest` uses decorators to declare modules, controllers, routes,
    middlewares, etc.

-   <Mark>**easy to use**</Mark> - `pest` is easy to use, and it's easy to get started with it.

And, obviously, everything that <FastapiTag/> and <StarletteTag/> provide.

Think of **<PestTag noicon/>** as an effortless way to organize your API, , grouping related 
business logic together in self-contained modules with scalability in mind, while retaining the 
flexibility that <FastapiTag nolink/> provides.

## Philosophy

**<PestTag/>** bases its philosophy on the following principles:

-   Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture
-   Domain Driven Design (DDD)
-   Separation of Concerns (SoC)
-   Dependency Injection (DI)
-   [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles
